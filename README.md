# tic-tac-toe

This was a quick project I threw together as I was messing around with JS and trying to get my head in the game prior to starting the Nucamp bootcamp.

** If I come back to this project, I would like to add the winner announcement as a modal and include the reset button there. Maybe make it partially transluscent?
